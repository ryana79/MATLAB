% Question 1(c)
% The matrix A is not a square matrix

% The matrix 0.1D is a diagonal matrix because it's square and
% when row # and column # dont match the number is 0
% Question 2(f)
% In general, multiplying a diagonal matrix(B) by a scalar(c) results in
% a diagonal matrix (cB) because the scalar operation affects only the
% elements on the main diagonal, leaving the off-diagonal elements unchanged.
% This property holds due to the structure of diagonal matrices, where
% non-diagonal entries are typically zero, making them invariant under scalar multiplication.
