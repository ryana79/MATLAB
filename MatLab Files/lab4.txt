% Question 2 (a)
% Since the first three columns of A are linearly independent (due to the linear combinations involving columns #1 and #2 of B), they form the 
% pivot columns of A and R. Columns #1, #2, and #5 of A are directly taken from B and are also linearly independent, which further confirms that % they are pivot columns.
% Column #3 of R, represented by [2, 3, 0], reflects a linear combination of columns #1 and #2
% of B. Similarly, column #4 of R, represented by [4, -5, 0] reflects a linear combination of
% columns #1 and #2 of B. The coefficients in R directly correspond to the scaling and addition operations
% applied to columns #1 and #2 of B to form columns #3 and #4 of A.
% Question 2 (b)
% The free variables are x3 and x4 since they don't have a pivot variable, so dim V = 2.

% with coefficients s and t: x=s*R(:,1)+t*R(:,2). Since R is the reduced row echelon form of A, the
% columns of R are linearly independent and form a basis for the column space of A. Any vector x in the
