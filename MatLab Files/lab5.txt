% Question 1 (a)

% Question 1 (ai)
% A has one positive eigenvalue
% Question 1 (aii)
% A has one negative eigenvalue
% Question 1 (aiii)
% The eigenvector x has about a length of 1, and the vector Ax has about a length of 1.5.
% The equation Ax=Î»x suggests that for the positive eigenvalue, we estimate it to be around 1.5.
% This comes from seeing that Ax is about 1.5 times bigger than x. For the negative eigenvalue, since
% Ax looks to be one-third the size of x but in the opposite direction, we guess the negative eigenvalue 
% to be -1/3.
% Question 1 (bi)
% No lines passing through the origin simultaneously include both Ax and x.
% Question 1 (bii)
% A lacks real eigenvectors and eigenvalues because there are no visual instances where Ax and x are 
% aligned or directly opposite each other.
% Question 2 
A = [1 3; 4 2]/4
A =
    0.2500    0.7500
    1.0000    0.5000
% Question 2 (a)
syms t; I = eye(2); p = det(A - t*I)
p =
t^2 - (3*t)/4 - 5/8
% det(A) = (0.25*0.5)-(0.75*1) = (0.125)-(0.75) = -0.625 = -5/8, and is equal to the constant
% term in p(t)
% Question 2 (b)
solve(p)
ans =
-1/2
 5/4
% The true values are fairly close to the estimated ones from the graph. This is observed
% when comparing the estimated values of 1.5 and -0.33 with the actual values of 1.25 and -0.5.
% Question 2 (c)
A = [3 1 ; -2 4 ]/4
A =
    0.7500    0.2500
   -0.5000    1.0000
syms t; I = eye(2); p = det(A - t*I)
p = 
t^2 - (7*t)/4 + 7/8
solve(p)
ans =
7/8 - (7^(1/2)*1i)/8
(7^(1/2)*1i)/8 + 7/8
% The eigenvalues of A are not real numbers but imaginary ones. As noted in Question 1(b),
% A lacks real eigenvectors and eigenvalues, which has been confirmed by determining the
% roots of the characteristic polynomial.

% Theorem 5.2 states that a square matrix A (size nxn) can be diagonalized if there exists
% a set of eigenvectors of A that forms a basis for R^n. Moreover, A can be expressed as
% A = PDP^-1, where D is a diagonal matrix and P is an invertible matrix, precisely when the columns
% columns of P form a basis of eigenvectors for R^n and the diagonal elements of D are the 
% eigenvalues associated with the eigenvectors in P. Thus, the calculations confirm that the
% columns of P serve as a basis of eigenvectors for R^n, with the diagonal elements of D as 
% the corresponding eigenvalues.
